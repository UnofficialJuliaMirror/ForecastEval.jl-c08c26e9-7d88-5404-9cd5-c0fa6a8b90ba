# ForecastEval

This is a Julia package for forecast evaluation. It is currently under development. First goal is to include Diebold Mariano (1995), Reality Check of White (2000), SPA test of Hansen (2005), and Model Confidence Set of Hansen, Lunde, Nason (2010). If I get time, I'll also try to code up the hybrid test of Song (2012). The aim is to have this all done by early June.
